For the following python files, download SnapPy as a Python module (see "https://snappy.computop.org/installing.html") and run them with python (they import snappy as a python module): TwoCentroids.py, Tetrahedral_hlgy_link.py, Compute.py, E4_all_triangulations.py.
The following files need to run with regina-python (see "https://regina-normal.github.io/docs/man-regina-python.html") - they import regina as a python module: Iso_sig.py, E_good_cover.py, E4_computations.py, 6220n_computation.py.
Some of the python files in this repository import other files from this repository and/or other outside modules or their functions. Details are given in the individual python files.
