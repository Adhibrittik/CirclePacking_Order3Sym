The codes and json files in this repository correspond to the article "Hidden symmetries and Dehn surgery on tetrahedral links".

For the following python files, download SnapPy as a Python module (see https://snappy.computop.org/installing.html) and run them with python (they import snappy as a python module): TwoCentroids.py, Tetrahedral_hlgy_link.py, Compute.py, E4_all_triangulations.py.

The following files need to be run with regina-python (see https://regina-normal.github.io/docs/man-regina-python.html): Iso_sig.py, E_good_cover.py, E4_computations.py, 6220n_computation.py.

Some of the python files in this repository import other codes/files from this repository and/or other outside modules/files/functions. 

Download all these other outside modules/files: SigToSeq.py and TestForCovers.py from https://github.com/Adhibrittik/orb_triangulation_tetrahedral, example.py and tetrahedralOrientableCuspedCensus.rga from https://unhyperbolic.org/tetrahedralCensus/tetrahedralCensus/regina/. 
(Not all of these outsides files are imported in each code in this repository. Look at the individual codes to see which codes import which modules/files/functions.) 

Before you run a code from this repository, keep all the codes and files of the repository as well as all the codes/modules/files downloaded from outside in the same directory of your computer so that they can interact with each other.
